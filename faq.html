<H3 id="faqrate">1. Setting wireless bitrates (and getting/setting more station information) [<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="toggle(this, 'faqratefold');">+</a>] </H3>

<div id="faqratefold" style="display:none;">
<H4>A. Station information in <tt>debugfs</tt></H4>

<p>When the NIC connects to another 802.11 device (when it's a client, the AP; when it's an AP, the clients), it creates an entry for that device in <tt>debugfs</tt>.  To see the list of these other stations, run the following command. Note that <tt>phy0</tt> may have a different number on your machine depending on what other wireless devices have been installed.</p>

<pre>
% ls /sys/kernel/debug/ieee80211/phy0/stations
00:0f:34:9d:01:a0
</pre>

<p>Here, you can see a list of all the MAC addresses this machine knows. My machine is in client node, so I will only see the MAC address for the AP. Inside that directory is a wide variety of useful info. I'll leave it up to the reader to explore. For now, let's focus on the <tt>rate_scale_table</tt> entry.</p>

<pre>
% sudo cat /sys/kernel/debug/ieee80211/phy0/stations/00:0f:34:9d:01:a0/rate_scale_table
sta_id 0
failed=0 success=0 rate=0FFF
fixed rate 0x0
valid_tx_ant ANT_A,ANT_B,ANT_C
lq type legacy
last tx rate=0x420A
general:flags=0x0 mimo-d=0 s-ant0x1 d-ant=0x3
agg:time_limit=4000 dist_start_th=3 frame_cnt_limit=31
Start idx [0]=0x0 [1]=0x0 [2]=0x0 [3]=0x0
 rate[0] 0x420A 1mbps
 rate[1] 0x420A 1mbps
 rate[2] 0x420A 1mbps
 ...
</pre>

<p>This gives us access to some basic information about the configuration of this client and that AP. For instance, we can see that all three transmit antennas are valid (<tt>valid_tx_ant ANT_A,ANT_B,ANT_C</tt>). We can see that this is not an 802.11n AP (<tt>lq type legacy</tt> &mdash; an 802.11n AP would say <tt>lq type HT</tt>). The last packet transmitted to this station was transmitted with rate <tt>0x420A</tt>, and we see below that that the rate used for all 16 transmit attempts is this same <tt>0x420A</tt>.<p>

<H4>B. How rates are represented</H4>

<p>Let's talk about this value <tt>0x420A</tt>. This value is usually stored in a variable that the driver calls <tt>rate_n_flags</tt>; it is a 32-bit unsigned integer and can be decomposed by looking at the <tt>RATE_MCS_</tt> flags and masks defined in <tt>iwl-commands.h</tt>. Here is a snippet:</p>

<pre>
/**

 */
</pre>

<p>Parsing these takes some getting used to, but soon you'll be reading rates trivially. I'll tell you now that this packet was sent on Antenna A (the <tt>0x4000</tt>). The packet was sent with one of the 802.11b CCK modulations (bit 8 is "0", bit "9" is 1, <tt>0x200</tt>). Finally, the packet was sent at 1 Mbps &mdash; the low order 6 bits are <tt>0xA</tt> which equal 10.</p>

<p>Breaking this down, we have:</p>

<pre>
0x420A =
           0x4000        (RATE_MCS_ANT_A_MSK = 0x4000)
         | 0x0200        (RATE_MCS_CCK_MSK = 0x200)
         | 0x000A        (10  &lt;&ndash;&gt;  1 Mbps)
</pre>

<p>For 802.11n (also called HT) rates, the rate_n_flags might look like this:</p>

<pre>
0x1c113 =
            0x1c000      (RATE_MCS_ANT_ABC_MSK &mdash; all 3 antennas)
          | 0x00100      (RATE_MCS_HT_MSK &mdash; this is an HT rate)
          | 0x00010      (2 &lt;&lt; RATE_MCS_SPATIAL_POS means 3 spatial streams)
          | 0x00003      (3 corresponds to the 16QAM-1/2, 26 Mbps modulation)
</pre>

<p>This is a MIMO packet using all 3 transmit antennas and 3 spatial streams, and it corresponds to the 3x26 Mbps rate that gives 78 Mbps in total.  Another way to think about the lower 8 bits of an HT rate is as the MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme). See Tables 20-29 through 20-43 in the IEEE 802.11n standard for more information. Note that, currently, Intel's NICs only support equal modulation with 3 or fewer streams, that is, MCS 0&ndash;23 and also MCS 32.</p>

<H4>C. Setting the transmit bitrate</H4>

<p>Intel has included a debug mode where you can set the transmit rate for a particular receiver. It sets all 16 attempts, in the case of a lossy link, to the same rate. Simply write the rate you wish to use into that same file.<p>

<pre>
% sudo -s
# echo 0x4214 &gt; /sys/kernel/debug/<b>...</b>/rate_scale_table
</pre>

<p>This should set the AP to use the 2 Mbps rate instead, since <tt>0x14</tt> equals 20.</p>

<p>Note that you have to escalate to a <tt>root</tt> shell to write that file; <tt>sudo echo 0x4214 &gt; /sys/<i>blah</i></tt> won't work because only the echo is run as <tt>root</tt>. You can get around this by using the <tt>tee</tt> program. [<a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=412329">hat tip</a>]</p>

<pre>
% echo 0x4214 | sudo tee -a /sys/kernel/debug/<b>...</b>/rate_scale_table
</pre>

<p>Of course, if you write an illegal value to this entry, the firmware will likely crash and the driver may simply stop working. Check the kernel log via <tt>dmesg</tt> if you suspect this may be happening.</tt> Here is an example of an illegal write:</p>

<pre>
% echo <font color="red"><b>0x14107</b></font> | sudo tee -a /sys/kernel/debug/<b>...</b>/rate_scale_table
</pre>

<p>Here I've told the NIC to use two antennas, A and C, but have only given it a single-stream MCS. This is of course an illegal selection; I can use Antenna A or Antenna C, but not both!</p>

<H3>2. Processing CSI with MATLAB [<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="toggle(this, 'inspectcsi');">+</a>] </H3>

<div id="inspectcsi" style="display:none;">
<i>The following instructions apply to MATLAB and were tested on a Mac OS X computer using MATLAB 7.11.0 (R2010b). They will likely work, with few adjustments, using Octave instead.</i>

<H4>A. Obtaining a CSI trace file</H4>

<p>If you followed the <a href="installation.html">installation instructions</a> correctly, at the very end you should have generated a trace of CSI matrices using the <tt>log_to_file</tt> program:</p>

<pre>
cd ~/netlink
sudo ./log_to_file tmp.dat
ping &lt;AP IP address&gt;
</pre>

<p>If so, you can use your CSI log (<tt>tmp.dat</tt>), but we also include a sample CSI trace file in the <tt>linux-80211n-csitool-supplementary</tt> git repository.</p>

<H4>B. Reading a CSI trace file into MATLAB</H4>

<p>After checking out the latest copy of the <tt>linux-80211n-csitool-supplementary</tt> repository, start MATLAB and navigate to the <tt>matlab</tt> subdirectory.</p>

<pre>
cd ~/linux-80211n-csitool-supplementary/matlab
</pre>

<p>Read in the sample data file (or your own log file):</p>

<pre>
csi_trace = read_bf_file('sample_data/log.all_csi.6.7.6');
</pre>

<p><b>Note that this uses the MEX-compiled <tt>read_bfee.c</tt> to unpack the binary CSI format.</b> If this does not work for you, ensure that <tt>read_bfee.mexmaci</tt> (32-bit) and <tt>read_bfee.mexmaci64</tt> (64-bit) are present or recompile <tt>read_bfee.c</tt> using your MATLAB's version of MEX.</p>

<p>In our sample file, <tt>csi_trace</tt> is a 1x29 cell array, which holds 29 structs. This contains the CSI information for 29 received packets. Let's inspect one of the entries:</p>

<pre>
&gt;&gt; csi_entry = csi_trace{1}	<b>(Note the curly-braces {}, not parentheses ().)</b>

csi_entry =

    timestamp_low: 0
       bfee_count: 72
              Nrx: 3
              Ntx: 1
           rssi_a: 33
           rssi_b: 37
           rssi_c: 41
            noise: -127
              agc: 38
             perm: [3 2 1]
             rate: 256
              csi: [1x3x30 double]
</pre>

<p>Let's break down this display:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b><tt>timestamp_low</tt></b> is the low 32 bits of the NIC's 1 MHz clock. It wraps about every 4300 seconds, or 72 minutes. This field was not yet recorded in the sample trace, so all values will be zero.</li>
	<li><b><tt>bfee_count</tt></b> is simply a count of the total number of beamforming measurements that have been recorded by the driver and sent to userspace. The <tt>netlink</tt> channel between the kernel and userspace is lossy, so these can be used to detect measurements that were dropped in this pipe.</li>
	<li><b><tt>Nrx</tt></b> represents the number of antennas used to receive the packet by this NIC, and <b><tt>Ntx</tt></b> represents the number of space/time streams transmitted. In this case, the sender sent a single-stream packet and the receiver used all 3 antennas to receive it.</li>
	<li><b><tt>rssi_a</tt></b>, <b><tt>rssi_b</tt></b>, and <b><tt>rssi_c</tt></b> correspond to RSSI measured by the receiving NIC at the input to each antenna port. This measurement is made during the packet preamble. This value is in <tt>dB</tt> relative to an internal reference; to get the received signal strength in <tt>dBm</tt> we must combine it with the Automatic Gain Control (AGC) setting (<b><tt>agc</tt></b>) in <tt>dB</tt> and also subtract off a magic constant. This process is explained below.</li>
	<li><b><tt>perm</tt></b> tells us how the NIC permuted the signals from the 3 receive antennas into the 3 RF chains that process the measurements. The sample value of <b><tt>[3 2 1]</tt></b> implies that Antenna C was sent to RF Chain A, Antenna B to Chain B, and Antenna A to Chain C. This operation is performed by an antenna selection module in the NIC and generally corresponds to ordering the antennas in decreasing order of RSSI.</li>
	<li><b><tt>rate</tt></b> is the rate at which the packet was sent, in the same format as the <tt>rate_n_flags</tt> defined <a href="#faqrate">above</a>. Note that the antenna bits are omitted, as there is no way for the receiver to know which transmit antennas were used.</li>
	<li><b><tt>csi</tt></b> is the CSI itself, normalized to an internal reference. It is a <tt><b>Ntx</b>&times;<b>Nrx</b>&times;30</tt> 3-D matrix where the third dimension is across 30 subcarriers in the OFDM channel. For a 20 MHz-wide channel, these correspond to about half the OFDM subcarriers, and for a 40 MHz-wide channel, this is about one in every 4 subcarriers. Which subcarriers were measured is defined by the 802.11n standard (in Table 7-25f on page 50).</li>
</ul>

<p>Now that we've described all the fields of this struct, we need to put them all together to compute the CSI in absolute units, rather than Intel's internal reference level. In particular, we need to combine the RSSI and AGC values together to get RSS in <tt>dBm</tt>, and include noise to get SNR. If there is no noise, as in the sample case, we instead use a hard-coded noise floor of <tt>-92</tt> <tt>dBm</tt>. We use the script <tt>get_scaled_csi.m</tt> to do this:<p>

<pre>
&gt;&gt; csi = get_scaled_csi(csi_entry);
</pre>

<p>Finally, <tt><b>csi</b></tt> is a <tt>1&times;3&times;30</tt> matrix that represents the MIMO channel state for this link. It's units are in linear&mdash;i.e., not <tt>dB</tt>&mdash;voltage space. This is the format used in all textbooks I've seen, that is, we've normalized the CSI (in textbooks, usually called <i>H</i>) such that there is unit noise.</p>

<H4>C. Inspecting the CSI</H4>

<p>Let's start by looking at the three different spatial paths on the <tt>1&times;3</tt> link we measured:</p>

<pre>
&gt;&gt; plot(db(abs(squeeze(csi).')))
&gt;&gt; legend('RX Antenna A', 'RX Antenna B', 'RX Antenna C', 'Location', 'SouthEast' );
&gt;&gt; xlabel('Subcarrier index');
&gt;&gt; ylabel('SNR [dB]');
</pre>

<p>In the plot command, <tt>squeeze()</tt> turns <b><tt>csi</tt></b> into a <tt>3&times;30</tt> matrix by removing the first singleton dimension. <tt>db()</tt> converts from linear (voltage) space into logarithmic (base-10, power) space. <tt>abs</tt> converts each complex number into its magnitude. Finally, the <tt><b>.'</tt></b> operator transposes the squeezed CSI from <tt>3&times;30</tt> matrix into a <tt>30&times;3</tt> matrix, and does not complement the complex numbers. Combined, we get the plot below.</p>

<center>
	<a href="img/sample_csi_plot.png"><img src="img/sample_csi_plot.png" width="400" title="a sample CSI plot"></a>
</center>

<p>We see that this is a mostly flat link, with relatively little frequency-selective fading (around <tt>3</tt> <tt>dB</tt> for most antenna pairs). However, there is a fair (perhaps <tt>8</tt> <tt>dB</tt>) difference between the best antenna C and the worst antenna A. This matches the difference between <b><tt>rssi_a</tt></b> and <b><tt>rssi_c</tt></b> (as we expect it should).</p>

<H4>D. Computing effective SNR values</H4>

<p>We'll conclude our discussion of the CSI by showing you how to compute the Effective SNR from our CSI matrices. To do so, we use the <tt>get_eff_SNRs</tt> script, which takes as input a CSI matrix and returns a <tt>7&times;4</tt> matrix of effective SNR values in linear (power) space. The 4 columns correspond to the effective SNR using the four 802.11 modulation schemes, namely BPSK/QPSK/16QAM/64QAM. The 7 rows correspond to the seven possible antenna selections with 3 antennas and 1, 2, or 3 spatial streams. In particular, the first 3 rows correspond to single-stream transmissions with antenna A, B, or C. The next 3 rows correspond to dual-stream transmissions with antennas AB, AC, or BC. The last row corresponds to a 3-stream transmission using all antennas.</p>

<pre>
&gt;&gt; db(get_eff_SNRs(csi), 'pow')

ans =

       Inf       Inf       Inf       Inf
 -156.5356 -156.5356 -156.5356 -156.5356
 -156.5356 -156.5356 -156.5356 -156.5356
 -156.5356 -156.5356 -156.5356 -156.5356
 -156.5356 -156.5356 -156.5356 -156.5356
 -156.5356 -156.5356 -156.5356 -156.5356
 -156.5356 -156.5356 -156.5356 -156.5356
</pre>

<p>Okay, that's pretty disappointing! What happened? Well, note that this is a <tt>1&times;3</tt> link, so the only valid antenna configuration is SIMO with the single transmit antenna we measured. The other 6 rows correspond to a very small SNR, i.e, a large, negative <tt>dB</tt>.</p>

<p>Also, this is a very strong link&mdash;the SNR is around 51 <tt>dB</tt> for the strongest antenna. Not only that, but we can see that all subcarriers are stronger than 40 <tt>dB</tt>, so the frequency-selective fading should cause few errors even using the highest rate. There is so little error, in fact, that MATLAB's error functions can't distinguish it from zero, and the SNR is effectively infinite.</p>

<p>Let's look at a <tt>3&times;3</tt> matrix instead:</p>

<pre>
&gt;&gt; csi_entry = csi_trace{20}

csi_entry =

    timestamp_low: 0
       bfee_count: 91
              Nrx: 3
              Ntx: 3
           rssi_a: 34
           rssi_b: 39
           rssi_c: 39
            noise: -127
              agc: 40
             perm: [2 3 1]
             rate: 272
              csi: [3x3x30 double]

&gt;&gt; csi = get_scaled_csi(csi_entry);
&gt;&gt; db(get_eff_SNRs(csi), 'pow')

ans =

       Inf       Inf       Inf       Inf
       Inf       Inf       Inf       Inf
       Inf       Inf       Inf       Inf
       Inf       Inf       Inf   39.0068
       Inf       Inf   38.1400   38.2261
       Inf       Inf   35.3323   35.4946
   13.9454   14.5517   17.1716   20.7060
</pre>

<p>Here, all 7 rows are valid because there are three transmit antennas. We see that all the SIMO streams are still very likely to work, as well as the MIMO2 transmissions, but only some of the MIMO3 rates will work. See our SIGCOMM 2010 paper for more details.</p>

<p>CSI is measured from a received packet under the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>The packet is received correctly.</p></li>
	<li><p>The packet is sent using an 802.11n "HT" rate.</p></li>
	<li><p>The packet is from a client to its AP, or an AP to its client, OR</p></li>
	<li><p>the packet is sent to a hardcoded, fixed address 00:16:ea:12:34:56 from a broadcast node. See the injection scripts.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, CSI is <strong>not</strong> recorded for overheard 802.11n conversations. It is also not recorded for beacons from a connected AP if they are sent a non-HT rate (e.g., the 802.11a/g 6 Mbps rate). I also note that there is only one CSI measurement per 802.11n A-MPDU (aggregation batch) since there is really only "one" preamble.</p>

<H3 id="program">9. The CSI Tool does not support a feature I want. Can I reprogram/modify the firmware source code? [<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="toggle(this, 'programfold');">+</a>] </H3>

<div id="programfold" style="display:none;">

	<p>No.</p>
	<p>We produced the modified firmware while employed at Intel with access to proprietary code, documents, and tools. We no longer have access to these tools and, unless you work at Intel, neither do you. Sorry!</p>
	<p>A very strong thank you to Intel for very graciously allowing us to use and distribute the binary version of the modified firmware!</p>

<H3 id="apmode">10. How do I deal with firmware crashes in AP mode? [<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="toggle(this, 'apmodefold');">+</a>] </H3>

<div id="apmodefold" style="display:none;">

	<p>The access point implementation on this chipset is fairly incomplete; the feature was started and abandoned internally, and the engineers never subjected it to rigorous tests. We enabled it for the CSI Tool as a hack. In our experiments, AP mode seemed to work well enough for links that also used an Intel 5300 client in a quiet network, but other Wi-Fi devices sometimes cause unavoidable crashes.</p>
	<p>In our own work, we found the CSI Tool to be most effective when using the injection scripts with devices in monitor mode. Client mode, AP mode, and ad-hoc modes never worked well, if at all, for us.</p>

<H3 id="injection">11. How can I get CSI measurements on multiple links at once? [<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="toggle(this, 'injectionfold');">+</a>] </H3>

<div id="injectionfold" style="display:none;">

	<p>First, please read #5 &ndash; "For which packets is CSI measured?". Hopefully, this description will make it clear why you are unlikely to ever get many good measurements in traditional AP/client networks.</p>
	<p>We recommend that you use injection mode for most multi-link measurements. Please see the instructions <a href="https://github.com/dhalperi/linux-80211n-csitool-supplementary/tree/master/injection">here</a>.</p>

<H3 id="logging">12. Can I log other information like payloads or sequence numbers for received packets? [<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="toggle(this, 'loggingfold');">+</a>] </H3>

<div id="loggingfold" style="display:none;">
  <p>First, please read #5 &ndash; "For which packets is CSI measured?". This answer provides useful background for understanding the relationship and interleaving between CSI measurements and other logs.</p>
  <p>You can find the information that may be logged by looking at the <a href="https://github.com/dhalperi/linux-80211n-csitool/blob/f3dba8bb3aac341fa1ffcae7c5d6815182493a5d/drivers/net/wireless/iwlwifi/iwl-connector.h#L62"><code>iwl-connector.h</code> header file</a> in the driver folder. Each of these flags may be set to relay one or more types of messages from the kernel to userspace programs like <code>log_to_file</code>.</p>
  <p>The default setting is <code>IWL_CONN_BFEE_NOTIF_MSK</code> -- the beamforming information feedback is logged. Other options:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Enabling <code>IWL_CONN_RX_PHY_MSK</code> will log additional physical information. However, we already copy the most relevant information from this structure into the beamforming response (<a href="https://github.com/dhalperi/linux-80211n-csitool/blob/f3dba8bb3aac341fa1ffcae7c5d6815182493a5d/drivers/net/wireless/iwlwifi/iwl-agn-lib.c#L59">see code here</a>).</li>
    <li>Enabling <code>IWL_CONN_RX_MPDU_MSK</code> will log packet payloads. This message should include, e.g., the IEEE 802.11 sequence number and of course packet payload which you could use for application or measurement-specific purposes.</li>
    <li>... other masks log other information, which it will benefit you the user to discover by reading the kernel. :)</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>To set which information is logged</strong>, please set the mask to the union of all information you require to be logged. For example, to log both CSI measurements and packet payloads, the mask would be <code>IWL_CONN_BFEE_NOTIF_MSK | IWL_CONN_RX_MPDU_MSK</code>, or <code>0x5</code>. Once you know the desired mask, you would set it by (re-)loading the <code>iwlwifi</code> module with the <code>connector_log</code> flag set:</p>
<pre>
modprobe iwlwifi connector_log=0x5
</pre>
<p>The default value for <code>connector_log</code> is <code>0</code>, and the recommended value in the <a href="installation.html">installation instructions</a> is <code>0x1</code>, which only logs beamforming information.</p>
